# easy_shell

A simple shell made using Go. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project to is to re-familiarize myself with Go while creating an easy to use shell.

## Use Case
The shell is intended to be use on Windows. However, for those who prefer to use unix commands, a chosen set
of key unix commands are supported. 

This is done by mapping the unix command to command-prompt commands. For instance, the user inputing "ls" will execute "dir" to display a list of directories.
